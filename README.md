# Commitment to Open Standards

The **Ephemeral Compute Attestation (ECA)** and **Static Artifact Exchange (SAE)** protocols are being developed as open standards and have been submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for community review and standardization.

This GitHub repository serves as the secondary home for these documents. This project fully supports the IETF's mission and community-driven process. To that end, should an official IETF working group be formed for these protocols, a transfer of the `internet-drafts` repository to an official IETF-managed location may follow, to ensure its vendor-neutral, long-term success.
