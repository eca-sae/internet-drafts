.# Abstract

Heterogenous workloads across multi-cloud, bare-metal, and edge environments often lack verifiable identities, relying instead on pre-shared secrets that enable impersonation if intercepted. Concurrently, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and other high-assurance workloads are limited to single point-in-time attestation when they otherwise require continuous verification of platform trustworthiness throughout long-running sessions.

This document specifies Entity and Compute Attestation (ECA), a protocol within the RATS architecture that addresses both challenges. ECA defines an identity bootstrap procedure where Attester and Verifier collaboratively act as an Identity Supplier to establish cryptographically verifiable identity for ephemeral workloads through proof of possession without the use of secrets like bearer tokens, and an attestation renewal procedure providing single round-trip verification bound to (D)TLS sessions via TLS Exported Authenticators. Both procedures are transport-agnostic and integrate with frameworks like WIMSE and SPIFFE/SPIRE. The bootstrap procedure's security properties have been formally analyzed (see Appendix A).

# Introduction

In many modern computing environments, such as bare-metal deployments, multi-cloud instances, or edge devices, workloads often lack a built-in, verifiable identity. This "Identity Vacuum" complicates trust establishment, forcing reliance on less secure methods like injected static secrets that if intercepted or leaked, could enable an attacker can use them to enroll a rogue workload.

Concurrently, high-assurance workloads, particularly those in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), require not only initial authentication but also continuous verification of their state. A point-in-time check is insufficient to detect compromises that may occur mid-session, creating a need for ongoing, stateful attestation that is cryptographically bound to the active communication channel.

This document specifies Entity and Compute Attestation (ECA), a protocol that profiles the Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture [@!RFC9334] to address these challenges. ECA defines two distinct cryptographic attestation procedures:

    1.  **Identity Bootstrapping:** For initial "cold start" establishment of verifiable identity in environments not yet provisioned.
    2.  **Attestation Renewal:** A lightweight, single round-trip attestation procedure for continuous verification of established identity and state, ideal for long-running workloads and TEEs.

The protocol is designed to be transport-agnostic and to integrate with existing identity frameworks and transport protocols such as (D)TLS.

# Motivation and Use Cases

This section describes scenarios where remote attestation enhances trust decisions by replacing static, possession-based secrets with cryptographic proof of a compute instance's identity and state. 

In the RATS model, the compute instance acts as an Attester, generating verifiable Evidence about its software and configuration. This Evidence is appraised by a Verifier, which produces a trusted Attestation Result (AR) for a Relying Party to consume, realizing the RATS Passport Model [@!RFC9334]. This fundamentally shifts the trust model from "who has the secret" to "what can be proven." 

The following use cases illustrate operational challenges that attestation can address.

## Bootstrapping Verifiable Identity in Constrained Environments

In environments without provider-backed identity mechanisms, such as bare-metal servers without TPMs or VMs limited to cloud-init, operators bootstrap trust by injecting static secrets into startup configuration. This creates a race condition where the first entity presenting the secret receives access, regardless of intended role. The resulting trust model depends on secret possession rather than verifiable identity.

Remote attestation can address this gap by enabling cryptographic proof of compute instance identity before credential release.

## Multi-Cloud Portability

When workloads migrate between cloud providers and on-premise environments, their provider-backed identity mechanisms are lost. Operators must then provision long-lived static credentials like API keys. This creates a risk where credential theft enables persistent workload impersonation.

Attestation can enable portable identity that survives migration across trust domains.

## Continuous TEE Verification

In confidential computing scenarios, clients establish sessions with TEE-based services after verifying initial attestation evidence. This point-in-time verification cannot detect post-handshake compromises. An attacker who compromises the TEE mid-session can exfiltrate sensitive data while the client continues operating under stale trust assumptions.

Continuous attestation can maintain trust throughout long-lived sessions.

# Conventions and Definitions {#conventions-and-definitions}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

**Attester**: An entity whose trustworthiness is to be evaluated, typically combining hardware, firmware and trusted software deployed in the cloud.

**Verifier**: Conducts appraisal of Evidence to evaluate trustworthiness of the Attester, enforcing validation gates against reference values.

  - The Verifier's appraisal relies on trust relationships with supply chain roles:
     - **Endorsers** (e.g., hardware manufacturers) provide cryptographic identity
     - **Reference Value Providers** supply expected measurements for appraisal
     - **Identity Suppliers** establish the Attester's cryptographic identity
     
**Relying Party**: Consumes signed Attestation Results to make authorization decisions.

**Entity Attestation Token (EAT):** A standardized token format [@!RFC9711] used to convey attestation evidence in a cryptographically verifiable form.

**Binding Factor (BF):** Attestation scope. A publicly verifiable, high-entropy value (â‰¥128 bits) that cryptographically scopes an attestation procedure to a specific context. The BF does not require confidentiality; protocol security relies on its binding to the Instance Factor, not secrecy. Context-specific semantics:

  - **Bootstrap:** Image digest, signed manifest, or SBOM reference
  - **Re-attestation:** Server's X.509 certificate public key

**Instance Factor (IF):** Platform Evidence. An inherent, measurable property of the instance that is verifiable by the Verifier. The IF value itself is never transmitted directly; instead, the Attester proves possession through cryptographic means (e.g., signature, quote, attestation report).

**Validator Factor (VF):** A confidential, ephemeral challenge generated and released by the Verifier during **identity bootstrap procedures** after successful initial authentication of BF+IF possession. The VF MUST be bound to the IF (e.g., `VF = SHA-256(seed || IF)`) to ensure secrecy against network attackers.

**Renewal Factor (RF):** Identity Token. A cryptographic credential proving identity continuity from a prior attestation procedure. The RF enables simplified attestation renewal without requiring a fresh interactive challenge. Examples include an Entity Attestation Token (EAT) from an identity bootstrap procedure or a vendor-provided instance identity document.

**Instance Factor Pattern (IFP):** The set of defined methods for sourcing the private value for Instance Factor (`IF`). Three patterns are defined: hardware-rooted (Pattern A), orchestrator-provisioned (Pattern B), and artifact-based (Pattern C). For detailed specifications, see [](#instance-factor-patterns-ifp).

**Joint Factor Possession:** The cryptographic property where security derives from proving knowledge of multiple factors (`BF`+`VF` for bootstrap, `BF`+`RF`+`IF` for attestation renewal) rather than secrecy of individual components.

**Integrity Hash Beacon (IHB):** A SHA-256 binding of `BF` to `IF` that enables exposure-tolerant authentication while preventing pre-computation attacks to mitigate MiTM threats.

**Exchange Identifier (eca_uuid):** A unique identifier for each attestation lifecycle instance, used to construct artifact repository paths and prevent replay attacks in SAE-based deployments.

**Procedure Binding:** The Instance Factor (IF) MUST be bound to the a unique identifier (e.g., the `eca_uuid` for ECA bootstrap) to ensure freshness and prevent replay.

**Artifact Repository:** A simple, addressable store (e.g., a web server, an object store) where peers can publish and retrieve cryptographic artifacts in SAE-based deployments.

# Conceptual Model (Informational) {#conceptual-model}

The ECA protocol defines a unified pattern for the attestation lifecycle through two distinct but related attestation procedures. A compute instance without a verifiable identity can be bootstrapped on Day 0 to obtain a verifiable identity, and then use that verifiable identity for efficient attestation renewal on an ongoing basis.

## Initial Identity Bootstrap (Bootstrap Procedure)

This three-phase attestation procedure establishes initial identity for instances starting without any verifiable identity (a "cold start").

1.  **Attester proves possession** of a public **Binding Factor (BF)** and a measurable **Instance Factor (IF)**.
2.  **Verifier validates this proof** and releases a secret challenge (**Validator Factor (VF)**).
3.  **Attester proves joint possession** of the factors to receive its initial credential, which can serve as a Renewal Factor (RF) for subsequent attestation procedures.

## Continuous Verification (Attestation Renewal Procedure)

This lightweight, single-phase attestation procedure that enables ongoing verification for instances that already possess a verifiable identity from a prior attestation (the **Renewal Factor, or RF**).

1.  **Attester presents** its existing credential (RF) along with fresh measurements (Instance Factor, IF).
2.  **Verifier validates** the credential and appraises the new measurements against its policy.

# Integration with Existing Frameworks {#integration-with-existing-frameworks}

## Alignment with Proposed SEAL Working Group {#seal-working-group-alignment}

This specification's **attestation renewal procedure** directly implements the proposed SEAL WG charter requirements for attested (D)TLS:

| SEAL Requirement | How ECA Satisfies |
|------------------|-------------------|
| **Per-connection freshness** | `certificate_request_context` bound into TEE Quote |
| **Leverage (D)TLS 1.3** | Via RFC 9261 Exported Authenticators |
| **Leverage RATS formats** | CMW, CoRIM, AR4SI, EAT |
| **No core (D)TLS modifications** | Only `cmw_attestation` extension |
| **Mutual attestation support** | Symmetric client/server attestation procedures |

## The SPIFFE/SPIRE Framework {#the-spiffespire-framework}

ECA can serve as a node attestor for the SPIFFE/SPIRE framework. While SPIFFE/SPIRE includes platform-specific node attestors, it relies on extensible plugins for custom environments. An ECA-based node attestor can be implemented for environments where provider metadata is insufficient or transports are constrained.

In these environments without a hardware root of trust, the primary software-based method for bootstrapping identity in SPIRE is the Join Token. This creates a significant security trade-off.

The Join Token is a **bearer token**, and its security model rests on the secure delivery of the token. If the token is intercepted or leaked, an attacker can use it to enroll a rogue workload.

ECA's identity bootstrap procedure offers a fundamentally more secure alternative by replacing this "possession of a secret" model with one based on verifiable proof of the compute instance's identity. Using measurable properties of the software instance itself (like its image digest), ECA generates a cryptographic proof that is bound to the compute instance, drastically reducing the risk of impersonation.

In this pattern, ECA precedes or augments SPIRE node admission. An Attester would perform an ECA bootstrap procedure to obtain an AR. This AR is then provided as input to a custom SPIRE node-attestor plugin. The plugin validates the AR and extracts claims from it (e.g., `eca_uuid`, EUID, IHB) to use as SPIRE selectors for registration policy. Once the node is admitted, SPIRE issues SVIDs as usual.

```
# Example of SPIRE registration entry using ECA-derived selectors

spire-server entry create -spiffeID "spiffe://example.org/my-service"  
\-parentID "spiffe://example.org/spire/agent/eca/\<verifier\_id\>"  
\-selector "eca:euid:a1b2c3d4..."  
\-selector "eca:ihb:e5f6g7h8..."
```

## ECA in a WIMSE Architecture {#eca-in-a-wimse-architecture}

In WIMSE deployments, ECA can provide both bootstrap and continuous attestation capabilities. The ECA Attester maps to the WIMSE Workload role, and the ECA Verifier maps to the WIMSE Identity or Attestation Service. ECA's primary function in a WIMSE workflow is to produce the initial, high-assurance credential (the AR), which a Workload can then exchange with a WIMSE Identity Service to obtain longer-lived runtime credentials (e.g., SVIDs, OAuth tokens).

### Role Mapping {#role-mapping}

When integrating ECA into a WIMSE-compliant system, the roles map as follows:

| ECA Role       | WIMSE Role                         | Description                                                                    |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attester** | **Workload** | The ephemeral compute instance requiring identity.                             |
| **Verifier** | **Identity or Attestation Service** | The entity within the trust domain that validates the workload's claims.       |
| **Relying Party** | **Service Consumer or Authorization Service** | An entity that consumes the Attestation Result to make an authorization decision. |

## BRSKI (Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure) {#brski-bootstrapping}

BRSKI [@?RFC8995] and ECA are complementary. BRSKI solves manufacturer-anchored onboarding for physical devices based on supply-chain provenance. ECA targets just-in-time software and instance attestation at runtime for ephemeral compute, which typically lacks a manufacturer-provided identity. An operator could use BRSKI to enroll a physical device, and subsequently use ECA for continuous attestation of the software state on that device.

# Identity Bootstrap Specification {#protocol-overview}

This section specifies the **identity bootstrap procedure** in detail. The attestation renewal procedure is specified in [](#attestation-renewal-specification).

The identity bootstrap procedure is the security-critical foundation of ECA. All formal security analysis ([](#app-formal-modelling-informative)) applies to this procedure type. It follows a three-phase process, beginning with the Attester in a Privileged Credential Vacuum and concluding with the Verifier producing a signed Attestation Result (AR) upon successful validation.

## Validation Gates {#sec-validation-gates}

The Verifier enforces a sequence of fail-closed validation gates in a specific order derived from the protocol's formal model. Each gate represents a critical check that must pass before proceeding.

### Phase 1 Appraisal Gates (Bootstrap)

1.  **MAC Verification:** Verifies the integrity of the Phase-1 payload using an HMAC tag derived from `BF` and `IF`.
    -   Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `MAC_INVALID`.

2.  **Instance Authorization:** Checks if the Attester's identity (e.g., derived from a unique attestation identifier or Instance Factor) is authorized to proceed.
    -   Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `ID_MISMATCH`.

3.  **IHB Validation:** Confirms that the received Integrity Hash Beacon (IHB) matches the expected value for the authorized instance.
    -   Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `IHB_MISMATCH`.

4.  **KEM Public Key Match:** Ensures the ephemeral encryption public key in the payload matches the expected key for the session.
    -   Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `KEM_MISMATCH`.

### Phase 3 Appraisal Gates (Bootstrap)

5.  **Evidence Time Window:** Validates that the `iat`, `nbf`, and `exp` claims in the final EAT are within an acceptable time skew (e.g., Â±60 seconds).
    -   Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `TIME_EXPIRED`.

6.  **EAT Schema Compliance:** Checks that the EAT contains all required claims with the correct types and encodings.
    -   Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `SCHEMA_ERROR`.

7.  **EAT Signature:** Verifies the Ed25519 signature on the EAT using the public key derived from `BF` and `VF`.
    -   Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `SIG_INVALID`.

8.  **Nonce Match:** Ensures the nonce in the EAT matches the nonce the Verifier issued in Phase 2, proving freshness.
    -   Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `NONCE_MISMATCH`.

9.  **JP Validation:** Verifies the Joint Possession proof, ensuring the final identity key is bound to the attestation procedure context.
    -   Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `KEY_BINDING_INVALID`.

10. **PoP Validation:** Verifies the final Proof-of-Possession tag, confirming the Attester's knowledge of both `BF` and `VF`.
    -   Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `POP_INVALID`.

11. **Identity Uniqueness (Replay):** Persists the terminal state for the unique attestation identifier and rejects any future attempts to use it.
    - Failure Action: Immediate termination. Publish error status `IDENTITY_REUSE`.

These gates align with the formal model's events (see [](#core-security-properties-bootstrap-model)):
- Gate 8 Nonce Match (per AttesterUsesNonce event).
- Gate 9 JP Validation (per VerifierValidatesWithKey event).
- Gate 10 PoP Validation (per VerifierAccepts event).

## Phase 1: Authenticated Channel Setup {#phase-1-authenticated-channel-setup}

-   **Attester** generates an ephemeral X25519 keypair deterministically from `BF` + `IF`.
-   Computes the Integrity Hash Beacon (IHB): `IHB = SHA-256(BF || IF)`.
-   Publishes a CBOR payload containing `{kem_pub, ihb}` and an associated HMAC tag to the repository.
-   **Verifier** retrieves the published artifacts and validates them against Gates 1-4.

## Phase 2: Challenge and Validator Factor Release {#phase-2-challenge-and-validator-factor-release}

- **Verifier** generates:
  - A fresh `VF` (â‰¥128 bits) 
  - A 16-byte nonce
  - A fresh ephemeral Ed25519 keypair for this specific bootstrap procedure
- Encrypts `{VF, nonce}` using HPKE to the Attester's ephemeral public key
- Signs the encrypted payload with the ephemeral procedure key (the Verifier's long-term identity key MUST NOT be used)
- Publishes the signed payload and the ephemeral public key to the repository
- **Attester** retrieves the published payload, verifies the signature using the published ephemeral public key, and decrypts the `VF`

## Phase 3: Joint Possession Proof {#phase-3-joint-possession-proof}

-   **Attester** derives a final Ed25519 signing keypair deterministically from `BF`+`VF`.
-   Creates a signed EAT containing identity claims, the Verifier's nonce, and a final Proof-of-Possession HMAC. The Proof-of-Possession is a critical step where the Attester proves knowledge of the secret `VF` without revealing it, typically by using it as a key for a MAC over the attestation procedure context.
-   Publishes the signed EAT to the repository.
-   **Verifier** retrieves the final EAT and validates it against Gates 5-11, yielding an Attestation Result (AR) upon success.

# Attestation Renewal Specification {#attestation-renewal-specification}

## Prerequisites {#Attestation Renewal Procedures-prerequisites}

-   The instance possesses a Renewal Factor (RF).
-   The Verifier has a record of the expected identity associated with the RF.
-   The Binding Factor (BF) remains stable or is updated according to policy.

## Generic Attestation Renewal Pattern {#generic-renewal-pattern}

The attestation renewal procedure is a single-phase exchange.

**Attester actions:**
1.  Collect the current Instance Factor (IF), such as fresh measurements or quotes.
2.  Construct an Evidence payload containing `{BF, RF, IF, attestation_procedure_id, timestamp}`.
3.  Sign the Evidence with a key derived from the RF.
4.  Transmit the signed Evidence to the Verifier.

**Verifier actions:**
1.  Receive the Evidence payload.
2.  Validate the RF signature against the known credential.
3.  Verify that the RF subject matches the expected identity for the BF.
4.  Appraise the IF measurements against policy.
5.  Confirm the `attestation_procedure_id` is unique to prevent replay.
6.  If all checks pass, emit an updated Attestation Result (AR).

### Validation Gates {#attestation-renewal-validation-gates}

1.  **RF Signature Verification**: Validates credential authenticity
    -   Failure: `CREDENTIAL_INVALID`

2.  **Identity Continuity**: Confirms RF subject matches expected identity
    -   Failure: `IDENTITY_MISMATCH`

3.  **Measurement Appraisal**: Verifies IF against policy (e.g., CoRIM)
    -   Failure: `MEASUREMENT_REJECTED`

4.  **Freshness Binding**: Ensures attestation_procedure_id is unique and properly bound
    -   Failure: `REPLAY_DETECTED` or `BINDING_INVALID`

5.  **Timestamp Validation**: Confirms Evidence timestamp within acceptable window
    -   Failure: `TIME_EXPIRED`

### Transport-Specific Implementations {#attestation-renewal-transport-specific}

The generic pattern above can be realized over different transports:

#### Session-Bound (D)TLS Pattern

When using TLS Exported Authenticators [@?RFC9261]:

-   **Binding Factor**: Server's X.509 certificate public key
-   **Renewal Factor**: Prior EAT from bootstrap
-   **Instance Factor**: Fresh TEE Quote with attestation_procedure_id in REPORTDATA
-   **attestation_procedure_id**: `certificate_request_context` from CertificateRequest

**Freshness**: Cryptographic binding of Quote to session context ensures per-connection freshness.

**Security**: TLS 1.3 forward secrecy + RF validation + Quote appraisal

See [](#concrete-example-continuous-tee-attestation-over-dtls) for complete example.

#### Repository-Based SAE Pattern

When using Static Artifact Exchange [@?I-D.ritz-sae]:

-   **Binding Factor**: Deployment manifest hash, image digest, or stable identifier
-   **Renewal Factor**: Prior EAT from identity bootstrap procedure
-   **Instance Factor**: Current measurements, runtime hashes, or provisioned secrets
-   **attestation_procedure_id**: `eca_uuid` (new unique identifier for this attestation renewal)

**Freshness**: Accept-once semantics for `eca_uuid`

**Security**: RF signature + repository access control + cryptographic binding

Repository structure:

```
/\<eca\_uuid\>/evidence.eat
/\<eca\_uuid\>/evidence.sig
/\<eca\_uuid\>/result.ar
/\<eca\_uuid\>/status
```

#### Custom Transport Pattern

Implementations using other transports MUST ensure:

-   RF signature verification
-   Attestation procedure identifier uniqueness (replay protection)
-   IF freshness (e.g., timestamps, nonces, or context binding)
-   Integrity protection of Evidence payload

# Post-Attestation Patterns {#post-attestation-patterns}

Once an attestation procedure concludes, the Attestation Result (AR) can be used to make policy decisions. A Verifier may transmit the AR to the successful Attester, which can then present it to Relying Parties (RPs) that trust the Verifier's signature. The full scope of AR presentation to RPs is outside the scope of this document.

      |                                                   |

      |                                                   |
      |<--------------------- Certificate / Token --------|
~~~

## Credential Lifecycle {#credential-lifecycle}

An AR from a successful identity bootstrap procedure serves as a renewable credential.

**Typical Lifecycle:**

1.  **Bootstrap:** An instance performs the full identity bootstrap procedure and receives an initial signed EAT (Attestation Result).
2.  **Transition:** The instance uses the EAT to establish a (D)TLS connection to a service.
3.  **Re-attestation:** The service periodically challenges the instance using the attestation renewal pattern to verify its current state.
4.  **Renewal:** Before credential expiration, the instance performs attestation renewal to receive an updated AR with extended validity.

## Chaining and Hierarchical Trust {#chaining-and-hierarchical-trust}

ECA attestation procedures can be chained to propagate trust across layers by using the signed AR from one attestation procedure as the Renewal Factor (RF) for a subsequent procedure. For example, a physical host can perform a bootstrap to prove hardware integrity, producing `AR_host`. A virtual machine on that host can then perform a attestation renewal procedure using `AR_host` as its RF to prove it is running on an attested physical host.

**Example (Bare-metal â†’ VM):**

1.  Physical host performs bootstrap with TPM-based IF (Pattern A)
    -   Output: `AR_host` proving hardware integrity

2.  VM on that host performs attestation renewal
    -   **RF:** `AR_host` (proves running on attested hardware)
    -   **IF:** VM-specific measurements
    -   Output: `AR_vm` proving "healthy VM on healthy host"

## Risks and Mitigations for Composable Deployments {#risks-and-mitigations-for-composable-deployments}

While ECA is designed to be composable (e.g., chaining attestations), realizing this benefit requires operational discipline. Operators should be aware of the following risks:

**Risks from Custom Integration:** The security of the overall system depends on the integrity of each link in the chain. Custom scripts or shims used to connect different attestation layers can inadvertently reintroduce vulnerabilities. It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use standardized, well-vetted integrations over bespoke "glue code."

**Organizational Friction:** In multi-team environments, clear ownership of the end-to-end attestation process is critical. Without a shared governance model, configuration drift between what DevOps provisions, what Security expects, and what the application implements can lead to systemic failures.

# Transport Considerations {#transport-considerations}

The ECA protocol is transport-agnostic. It can be deployed over any mechanism that supports artifact exchange, freshness guarantees, and immutability of published artifacts. This section provides non-normative guidance on transport selection.

## Identity Bootstrap Procedure Transports {#bootstrap-transports}

**Static Artifact Exchange (SAE)** [@I-D.ritz-sae] is RECOMMENDED for identity bootstrap procedures in constrained environments, such as those without direct network connectivity or in zero-trust networks. Its pull-only, repository-based model minimizes the attack surface. Other transports like direct HTTP/HTTPS or message queues MAY be used.

## Attestation Renewal Transports {#attestation renewal-transports}

**TLS 1.3 Exported Authenticators** [@?RFC9261] with the `cmw_attestation` extension [@?I-D.fossati-tls-exported-attestation] are RECOMMENDED for attestation renewal in interactive services requiring per-connection freshness, such as long-running TEE-based workloads. This provides a single round-trip attestation renewal cryptographically bound to the TLS session.

## Transport Selection Guidance {#transport-selection-guidance}

| Scenario             | Bootstrap     | Re-attestation |
| :------------------- | :------------ | :------------- |
| **Zero-trust cloud** | SAE           | (D)TLS         |
| **Bare-metal** | SAE           | SAE or (D)TLS  |
| **TEE services** | SAE or (D)TLS | (D)TLS         |
| **Air-gapped** | SAE           | SAE            |
| **Embedded/IoT** | Custom        | Custom         |

# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

This section addresses security properties and considerations for ECA attestation procedures.

## Security Analysis Scope {#security-analysis-scope}

The formal security analysis presented in this document (see [](#app-formal-modelling-informative)) and the cryptographic security properties verified apply specifically to the **identity bootstrap procedure** in zero-trust scenarios. The identity bootstrap procedure assumes no prior relationship between Attester and Verifier and must establish initial trust through cryptographic proof of joint factor possession.

Attestation renewals, which assume an existing credential from prior attestation, operate under different threat models and are not covered by the formal verification presented here. Security properties of attestation renewal depend on:

-   The security of the initial identity bootstrap procedure.
-   The integrity of the Renewal Factor (RF) credential.
-   Transport-specific security properties (e.g., TLS 1.3 channel security for session-bound attestation renewal).

Future work may extend formal analysis to attestation renewal scenarios.

## Identity Bootstrap Procedure Security {#identity-bootstrap-procedure-security}

The Verifier's ability to appraise evidence is anchored in a trust model that relies on upstream supply chain roles. An Endorser (e.g., a hardware manufacturer) supplies endorsements for the hardware's authenticity, while a Reference Value Provider supplies the expected 'golden' measurements for the software stack. The Verifier is configured to trust these entities when making its appraisal decision.

**Trust Boundaries:** Without hardware roots of trust, the security scope is limited to passive network observers rather than compromised infrastructure providers. Hardware-rooted Instance Factor Pattern A addresses this limitation. For detailed pattern specifications, see [](#instance-factor-patterns-ifp). This hardware-based protection is critical for mitigating State Reveal attacks, as a formal analysis confirmed that a compromise of the Attester's software environment can expose ephemeral keys used in the attestation procedure (see [](#attester-state-reveal)).

**Secrets Handling:** Derived keys are sensitive cryptographic material. Implementations MUST handle them securely in memory (e.g., using locked memory pages) and explicitly zeroize them after use.

## Attestation Renewal Security {#attestation-renewal-security}

Re-attestation security derives from:

1.  **Bootstrap foundation**: The initial credential established via a cryptographically verified bootstrap acts as the Renewal Factor (RF).
2.  **Transport security**: Channel properties (e.g., TLS 1.3 forward secrecy).
3.  **Continuous appraisal**: Fresh IF measurements validated against policy.
4.  **Replay protection**: Attestation procedure identifier uniqueness enforcement.

**Note**: Unlike identity bootstrap procedures, attestation renewal does NOT protect against initial identity forgery. If an attacker compromises the identity bootstrap procedure, they can obtain a valid `RF` and perform subsequent attestation renewals. Therefore, security of the identity bootstrap procedure (including a hardware-rooted IF for zero-trust scenarios) remains critical for overall system security.

## Impersonation Risk {#impersonation-risk}

The security properties of the identity bootstrap procedure depend on an adversary being unable to generate a valid cryptographic proof for an Instance Factor (IF) they do not legitimately possess. An impersonation attack would require an adversary to forge a proof (e.g., a TPM quote) corresponding to a known `IF` for a specific attestation procedure's Binding Factor (BF). The protocol's primary defense is that the `IF` itself is never transmitted, only a proof derived from it. Therefore, operational controls MUST protect the integrity of the measurement source (e.g., a vTPM) and the out-of-band channel through which the Verifier learns the expected measurement.

To reduce this risk, operators SHOULD minimize the time window between when an Attester becomes operational with its `BF` and when a Verifier is available to appraise its evidence.

## Threat Models {#threat-models}

ECA is designed to address two key threat models: the **Network Attacker** (a Dolev-Yao-style MiTM who controls communication but not participant state) and the **Malicious Provider** (a privileged insider with control-plane access). Analysis from an exploratory ProVerif model suggests that the protocol, as modelled, defeats the Network Attacker through its cryptographic binding and joint possession proofs.

The choice of Instance Factor Pattern directly maps to the desired security goals:
-   **IFP Patterns B and C** are sufficient for workload portability and standardization. They protect against Network Attackers but assume the underlying infrastructure provider is trusted.
-   **IFP Pattern A** is designed for high-assurance and zero-trust environments. By anchoring the `IF` in a hardware root of trust (HRoT), it is sufficient to mitigate the Malicious Provider threat model.

## Attester State Compromise {#attester-state-compromise}

The formal model confirms that the protocol cannot maintain secrecy of the Validator Factor (VF) if the Attester's runtime state is compromised and its ephemeral decryption key is extracted. A formal "State Reveal" analysis was conducted where the Attester's ephemeral private key was deliberately leaked to an attacker (see [](#attester-state-reveal)). The model confirmed that this compromise allows a passive network attacker to intercept and decrypt the Phase 2 ciphertext from the Verifier, revealing the `VF`.

This result establishes the protocol's security boundary regarding the Attester's runtime state. The only viable mitigation for this threat is the use of IFP Pattern A (hardware-rooted), where the Instance Factor and all keys derived from it are protected by a hardware root of trust.

## Verifier Key Compromise Impact Analysis {#verifier-key-compromise-impact-analysis}

The Verifier uses two distinct types of keys in the identity bootstrap procedure:

1. **Ephemeral Procedure Key**: Used to sign Phase 2 artifacts (`VF` + `vnonce`)
2. **Long-term Identity Key**: Used to sign final Attestation Results (`AR`)

## Key Management Requirements {#key-management-requirements}

### Ephemeral Procedure Keys

- MUST be generated fresh for each identity bootstrap procedure
- MUST be discarded after procedure completion
- SHOULD use Ed25519 for performance and security

#### Ephemeral Procedure Key Compromise

The Verifier MUST generate a fresh ephemeral keypair for each identity bootstrap procedure to sign Phase 2 artifacts. This key is single-use and discarded after the procedure completes.

If an ephemeral procedure key is compromised during an active bootstrap procedure, an attacker could:
- Inject forged (VF', nonce') pairs for that specific procedure
- Cause the Attester to derive incorrect final identity keys

However, the protocol's cryptographic design ensures this only enables denial of service, not authentication bypass:
- The resulting Evidence will contain wrong nonce (fails Gate 8)
- Wrong JP proof (fails Gate 9)  
- Wrong PoP tag (fails Gate 10)
- No legitimate Verifier should accept this Evidence

### Long-term Identity Keys  

- MUST be protected as high-value assets
- MUST be used only to sign final Attestation Results
- SHOULD be rotated according to organizational policy
- MAY be backed by organizational PKI for trust distribution

#### Long-term Identity Key Compromise

Compromise of the Verifier's long-term identity key used to sign Attestation Results would allow an attacker to forge ARs. This represents a complete compromise of the trust domain and requires immediate revocation and reissuance of the Verifier's identity credentials.

The impact is independent of transport mechanism and affects all relying parties that trust the compromised key.

# Non-Goals {#non-goals}

ECA explicitly does not attempt to address several related but distinct problems:

- **Software-Based Mitigation of Hypervisor Threats:** ECA does not replace the need for HRoTs where the threat model must assume a compromised service provider, hypervisor, or related platform risks.

- **Replacement for Single-Cloud IMDS:** ECA is not intended to replace provider-native IMDS for workloads operating within a single, trusted cloud environment.

- **Infrastructure Trust Bootstrapping:** ECA assumes operational mechanisms exist for manifest distribution, Verifier discovery, and PKI infrastructure. It integrates with existing trust foundations rather than replacing them.

- **Identity Framework Replacement:** ECA is designed to complement systems like SPIFFE/SPIRE, for example by acting as a high-assurance node attestor.

- **Manufacturer Provenance:** ECA handles runtime attestation and does not provide supply-chain attestation or manufacturer-anchored trust.

# Operational Considerations {#operational-considerations}

**Scalability:** The use of a simple artifact repository allows for high scalability using standard web infrastructure like CDNs and object storage.

**Time Synchronization:** Reasonably synchronized time is REQUIRED for proper validation of time-based claims. The use of a time synchronization protocol like NTP [@?RFC5905] is RECOMMENDED.

**Polling:** Polling MUST use exponential backoff with jitter.

**Provisioning and Repository Access:** The ECA protocol requires the Attester to publish artifacts while adhering to the **Privileged Credential Vacuum** principle. This can be achieved using standard cloud primitives that grant ephemeral, narrowly-scoped write capabilities without provisioning long-term secrets, such as a time-limited pre-signed URL for an object store.

# IANA Considerations {#iana-considerations}

TODO IANA

# Implementation Status {#implementation-status}

An end-to-end implementation of the bootstrap profile is publicly available at [[ECA-SAE-PROTOTYPE](#ext-links)], demonstrating the three-phase attestation procedure, HPKE-based challenge delivery, COSE-based Evidence, and SAE transport. The reference implementation achieves protocol execution in approximately 1.3 seconds.

# Acknowledgments {#acknowledgments}

The design of this protocol was heavily influenced by the simplicity and security goals of the age file encryption tool. The protocol's core cryptographic mechanisms would not be as simple or robust without the prior work of the IETF community in standardizing modern primitives, particularly Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) in [@?RFC9180].

The integration with Exported Authenticators draws from [@?I-D.fossati-tls-exported-attestation].

The SEAL Working Group charter and Confidential Computing Consortium Attestation SIG provided the use case requirements that shaped the attestation renewal model.

# Formal Modelling (Informative) {#app-formal-modelling-informative}

This appendix presents formal security analysis of the **ECA identity bootstrap procedure** using ProVerif [[ECA-FORMAL-MODELS](#ext-links)]. The analysis assumes a powerful Dolev-Yao network attacker and verifies core security properties.

**Scope limitation**: This analysis covers ONLY identity bootstrap procedures. Attestation renewals operate under different trust assumptions (existing credential from prior attestation) and are not modeled here. Future work may extend formal analysis to attestation renewal scenarios.

The protocol's bootstrap security properties were analyzed using an exploratory formal model in ProVerif. The model assumes a powerful Dolev-Yao network attacker who can intercept, modify, and inject messages. It also correctly models the Binding Factor (`BF`) as public knowledge from the start, as per the protocol's "exposure tolerance" principle ([](#core-design-principles)).

The analysis was conducted in two parts: verification of the core security properties against a network attacker, and an analysis of the protocol's behavior under specific key compromise scenarios to define its security boundaries.

## Core Security Properties (Bootstrap) {#core-security-properties-bootstrap-model}

In the baseline model, all core security goals were successfully shown to hold against a network attacker.

| Property | ProVerif Query | Result | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | `inj-event(VerifierAccepts(...)) ==> inj-event(AttesterInitiates(...))` | **True** | The Verifier only accepts an attestation if a unique Attester legitimately initiated it. This prevents an attacker from impersonating the Attester. |
| **Freshness** | `event(AttesterUsesNonce(n)) ==> event(VerifierGeneratesNonce(n))` | **True** | The Attester will only use a nonce that was genuinely generated by the Verifier for that attestion procedure. This property is the basis for **Gate 8 (Nonce Match)** and prevents replay attacks. |
| **Key Binding** | `event(VerifierValidatesWithKey(pk)) ==> event(AttesterPresentsKey(pk))` | **True** | The final identity key that the Verifier checks is unambiguously bound to the Attester that participated in the attestation procedure, validating **Gate 9 (JP Validation)**. |
| **Confidentiality** | `not (event(VFReleased(vf)) && attacker(vf))` | **True** | The secret `ValidatorFactor` (`VF`) is never revealed to a network attacker, satisfying a fundamental security goal of the protocol. |

## Boundary Analysis (Advanced Threat Models) {#boundary-analysis-advanced-threat-models}

Additional tests were performed to formally define the protocol's security boundaries under specific compromise scenarios.

### Key Compromise Impersonation (KCI) {#key-compromise-impersonation-kci}

A test was conducted where an attacker compromises an `InstanceFactor` (`IF`) from one attestation procedure and attempts to impersonate a Verifier in a different procedure. The model indicated this attack is not possible. The KCI security query passed, confirming that compromising a secondary factor (`IF`) does not allow an attacker to forge messages from a primary party (the Verifier), as they still lack the Verifier's private signing key.

### Verifier Key Compromise {#verifier-key-compromise}

A test was conducted modeling a compromised long-term Verifier signing key:

- **Result:** The model demonstrated that an attacker can inject arbitrary (VF', nonce') pairs, breaking the Freshness property (`event(AttesterUsesNonce(n)) ==> event(VerifierGeneratesNonce(n))` was **False**).

- **Interpretation:** While the formal model identifies a freshness violation, the protocol's cryptographic design ensures this only enables denial of service, not authentication bypass:

- The attacker can cause the Attester to derive keys from (`BF`, `VF'`)
- However, the resulting Evidence will contain:
  - Wrong nonce (fails Gate 8)
  - Wrong JP proof (fails Gate 9)
  - Wrong PoP tag (fails Gate 10)
  - No correctly implemented Verifier should accept this Evidence

Furthermore, when using SAE transport [@I-D.ritz-sae], even this DoS attack becomes infeasible without repository write access, as noted in [](#with-sae-transport-pull-only-model).

- **Mitigation:** This analysis provides the formal rationale for:
  - the requirement in [](#with-direct-communication-transports) for ephemeral keys with push-capable transports
  - the relaxed guidance in [](#with-sae-transport-pull-only-model) when using SAE transport

### Attester State Reveal {#attester-state-reveal}

A test was conducted modeling a compromised Attester whose ephemeral private decryption key is leaked:

- **Result:** The model demonstrated that this allows a passive attacker to decrypt the Phase 2 ciphertext and steal the `ValidatorFactor` (`VF`) (`not (event(VFReleased(vf)) && attacker(vf))` was **False**).

- **Interpretation:** This result formally establishes the security boundary discussed in [](#attester-state-compromise)

- **Mitigation:** This analysis provides the formal rationale for hardware-rooted Instance Factor Pattern A when the threat model must assume compromise of the underlying provisioning platform. For pattern specifications, see [](#instance-factor-patterns-ifp).

# ECA-VM-BOOTSTRAP-V1 Reference Profile {#bootstrap-reference-profile}

> Stability note: This profile documents the concrete choices used by the reference prototype to enable experimentation and interop. It is non-normative and may change in future drafts based on feedback.

## Primitives {#primitives}

- Hash / KDF: HKDF-SHA-256 (RFC5869), SHA-256 (RFC6234)
- MAC: HMAC-SHA-256
- Signatures: Ed25519 (RFC8032)
- KEM/HPKE: X25519 + HPKE base mode (RFC9180) for Verifier -> Attester secrecy in Phase 2. The attestation procedure identifier is used as the AAD, and the `info` parameter for key derivation is `"ECA/v1/hpke"`.
- Nonces: Verifier freshness `vnonce` is exactly 16 bytes (encoded base64url, unpadded)

## Integrity Hash Beacon (IHB) {#integrity-hash-beacon-ihb}

- `IHB = SHA-256( BF || IF )`, rendered as lowercase hex for transport where necessary.

## Deterministic Key Material {#deterministic-key-material}

All keys are deterministically derived from attestation procedure inputs via domain-separated HKDF invocations. Notation: `HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM)` then `HKDF-Expand(PRK, info, L)`. The attestation procedure identifier is appended to the `salt` in all derivations to ensure session uniqueness.

- **Phase 1 MAC key (Attester artifact MAC)**

  - `IKM = BF || IF`
  - `salt = "ECA:salt:auth:v1" || attestation_procedure_id`
  - `info = "ECA:info:auth:v1"`
  - `K_MAC_Ph1 = HKDF-Expand( HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM), info, 32 )`
  - Usage: HMAC-SHA-256 over the CBOR Phase-1 payload bytes.

- **Phase 2 ECDH/HPKE seed (Attester's ephemeral X25519 keypair)**

  - `IKM = BF || IF`
  - `salt = "ECA:salt:encryption:v1" || attestation_procedure_id`
  - `info = "ECA:info:encryption:v1"`
  - `seed32 = HKDF-Expand( HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM), info, 32 )`
  - The Attester forms an X25519 private key by clamping `seed32` per RFC7748; the public key is derived normally.
  - The Verifier uses HPKE with the Attester's public key to encrypt `{VF, vnonce}`.

- **Phase 3 signing key (Attester's Ed25519 identity keypair)**

  - `IKM = BF || VF`
  - `salt = "ECA:salt:composite-identity:v1" || attestation_procedure_id`
  - `info = "ECA:info:composite-identity:v1"`
  - `sk_seed32 = HKDF-Expand( HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM), info, 32 )`
  - The Attester initializes Ed25519 with `sk_seed32` as the private key seed and derives the corresponding public key.

- **HPKE KDF `info` parameter:** `info = "ECA/v1/hpke"`

## Phase Artifacts {#phase-artifacts-profile}

*This section provides a high-level description of the payloads. For concrete byte-for-byte examples, see the reference implementation.*

### Phase 1 Payload (Attesterâ†’Repo) {#phase-1-payload-attester-repo-profile}

The Phase-1 payload is a CBOR map containing the following claims, which is then protected by an external HMAC tag.

| Claim | Value Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `kem_pub` | `bstr` (raw 32 bytes) | Attester's ephemeral X25519 public key. |
| `ihb` | `tstr` (lowercase hex) | Integrity Hash Beacon. |

### Phase 2 Payload (Verifier -> Repo) {#phase-2-payload-verifier-repo-profile}

The Phase-2 payload is a signed CBOR map containing the following claims.

| Claim | Value Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `C` | `tstr` (base64url unpadded) | HPKE ciphertext |
| `vnonce` | `tstr` (base64url unpadded) | The Verifier-generated nonce. |

The plaintext for HPKE encryption is the direct concatenation of the raw bytes: `plaintext = VF || vnonce`.

### Phase 3 Payload (Attester -> Repo) {#phase-3-payload-attester-repo-profile}

The Phase-3 payload is a signed EAT as defined in [](#evidence-claims). The profile-specific constructions for proofs are as follows:

- **Joint-Possession Proof (concrete for this profile):**
  - `jp_proof = SHA-256( BF || VF )`, rendered as lowercase hex.
- **Proof-of-Possession (concrete for this profile):**
  - First, a bound hash is computed from the session context:
    - `bound_data = attestation_procedure_id || IHB_bytes || eca_attester_id_bytes || vnonce_raw_bytes`
    - `bound_hash = SHA-256( bound_data )`
  - Then, a dedicated MAC key is derived:
    - `IKM = BF || VF`
    - `salt = "ECA:salt:kmac:v1" || attestation_procedure_id`
    - `info = "ECA:info:kmac:v1"`
    - `K_MAC_PoP = HKDF-Expand( HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM), info, 32 )`
  - Finally, the PoP tag is computed over the bound hash:
    - `pop_tag = base64url( HMAC-SHA-256( K_MAC_PoP, bound_hash ) )`
- The `jp_proof` and `pop_tag` are included in the EAT, which is then signed with the Attester's Ed25519 key.

## Verification (Verifier) {#verification-verifier-profile}

- Verify Phase-1 MAC with `K_MAC_Ph1`.
- Verify the signed Phase-2 payload with the Verifier's public key; HPKE-Open with Attester's kem key to recover `{VF, vnonce}`.
- Recompute Attester signing key from `BF||VF` and verify the EAT signature.
- Recompute `jp_proof` and `pop_tag` inputs and compare constant-time.
- Apply local appraisal policy; on success, emit an Attestation Result bound to attestation procedure identifier.

## Interop Notes {#interop-notes}

- **Encodings:** All binary fields referenced in EAT must be explicitly encoded (e.g., base64url) and stated as such in the claims table. NumericDate claims (`iat`, `nbf`, `exp`) use 64-bit unsigned integers.
- **Side-Channel Resistance:** To mitigate timing attacks, implementations SHOULD use constant-time cryptographic comparisons. Payloads that are inputs to cryptographic operations (e.g., Evidence) MAY be padded to a fixed size using a length-prefix scheme to ensure unambiguous parsing.

# Concrete Example: Continuous TEE Attestation over (D)TLS {#concrete-example-continuous-tee-attestation-over-dtls}

This appendix provides a complete example of attestation renewal for a long-running TEE workload using (D)TLS Exported Authenticators, integrating the work established by Fossati et al. [@?I-D.fossati-tls-exported-attestation].

## Scenario {#scenario}

We consider Server as Attester.
- Client establishes initial TLS 1.3 connection to TEE-based service
- Service performed bootstrap via ECA/SAE during provisioning
- Client needs to verify TEE health before processing sensitive data
- Service presents current measurements via attestation renewal

# Change log

## Changes since -00

This revision represents a significant architectural evolution of the ECA protocol based on deeper understanding of the existing Attestation landscape. The scope has been expanded from a single identity bootstrap procedure to a comprehensive attestation pattern.

### Major Architectural Changes

* **Dual-Attestation Model:** The protocol is no longer a single three-phase attestation procedure. It now defines two distinct but related attestation procedures:
    1.  **Identity Bootstrapping:** For initial "cold start" establishment of verifiable identity in environments not yet provisioned.
    2.  **Attestation Renewal:** A lightweight, single round-trip attestation procedure for continuous verification of an established identity, ideal for long-running workloads and TEEs.

* **New Session-Bound Deployment Model:** A primary deployment model using **(D)TLS Exported Authenticators** has been introduced. This aligns the protocol with the **SEAL WG charter** and directly supports continuous attestation for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

* **Consolidation of Implementation Guide:** Key concepts from the separate implementation guide (`draft-ritz-eca-impl-00`) have been merged into this core specification for clarity and completeness. This includes:
    * **Instance Factor Patterns (IFP):** The Hardware-Rooted (A), Orchestrator-Provisioned (B), and Artifact-Based (C) patterns are now formally part of the core draft.
    * **Reference Profile and Examples:** A concrete reference profile (`ECA-VM-BOOTSTRAP-V1`) and a detailed (D)TLS example have been included as appendices.
    * **Implementation Status:** The section detailing the prototype's status is now included.

### Scope and Terminology Refinements

* **Protocol Renaming:** The draft is now titled **"Entity and Compute Attestation"** (formerly "Ephemeral Compute Attestation") to reflect its broadened applicability to both ephemeral and long-running entities.
* **New Terminology:** Introduced new core terms to support the Dual-Attestation  model, most notably the **Renewal Factor (RF)**, which is the credential used to prove identity continuity in attestation renewal procedures. The roles of **Binding Factor (BF)** and **Instance Factor (IF)** have been clarified for each attestation procedure type.

### Expanded Integration and Use Cases

* **WIMSE and SEAL Alignment:** The document now explicitly maps ECA roles and concepts to the **WIMSE (Workload Identity in Multi-Cloud Secure Environments)** architecture and details its alignment with the proposed **SEAL (Secure Evidence and Attestation Layer)** working group's goals.
* **Post-Attestation Patterns:** Added a new section that describes the credential lifecycle, stateful attestation renewal, and patterns for chaining attestations to build hierarchical trust.

### Editorial Changes

* Added **Muhammad Usama Sardar** as a co-author.
* **FURTHER** restructured the document significantly to introduce the conceptual model and deployment patterns upfront.
* Retained ECA-VM-BOOTSTRAP-V1 profile for interop testing
* Replaced "ceremony" with "attestation procedure" or simply "procedure".
* Replaced "re-attestation" with "attestation renewals"
* Updated the formal model analysis in the appendix to reflect the protocol's evolution and provide clearer interpretations of the security boundary tests.
